# Hi â€” I'm B Sruthi Reddy ðŸ‘‹

**Computer Vision & Robotics Engineer** â€” M.Sc.  
Python | PyTorch | OpenCV | ROS2 | PyTorch | Git | Flask

I build vision systems for robotics and automation (object detection, 6D pose estimation, gripper automation) and explore 3D neural rendering (NeRF / Gaussian splatting).

## Featured Projects
- **YOLOv5 + 6D Pose Estimation** â€” end-to-end pipeline for object detection + pose estimation (robotic grasping).  
- **Vision-Driven Smart Gripper** â€” pipeline integrating camera perception with ROS2 controls.  
- **Mini NeRF Demo** â€” small 3D neural rendering example (reconstruction & visualization).
